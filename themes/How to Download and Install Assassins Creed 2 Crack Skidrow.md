## Step 2: Extract Assassin's Creed 2 Crack Skidrow
 
Once you have downloaded the crack file, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.

These are the files that will replace the original ones in the game folder and allow you to play without DRM.

The next step is to copy the crack files to the game folder. To do this, you need to locate where you installed Assassin's Creed 2 on your PC. The default location is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Assassin's Creed II". If you changed it during installation, you need to find it yourself.
 
Once you have found the game folder, open it and look for another folder named "orbit". This is where the original DRM files are stored. You need to delete them or move them to another location as a backup. Then, copy the two files from the "Skidrow" folder and paste them into the "orbit" folder.
